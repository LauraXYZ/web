# Algorithm Registry
The demo Url:http://zhao.uattoken.cn/#/

This product the market through socialfi algorithm was presented, including algorithm registration, algorithm to upload, publish, subscribe, algorithm test.
Social platform algorithm provides a unified market access standard, and has the automatic deployment.Developers can provide own algorithm for the use of other developers, and updating algorithm, maintenance and other operations.
Through the algorithm of market platform, developers will be able to see their algorithm is invoked, at the same time with the help of a platform to find like-minded algorithm development partners.
